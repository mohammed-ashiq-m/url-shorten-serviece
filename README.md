In this repository I will be developing a url shortener service with the help of mongoDB database and basic encoding and decoding.<br>Normal URLs (which can be over a hundred characters long) and transform them into manageable links that almost never exceed 20 characters.
## URL shortener:
A url shortener written in Nodejs with the help of *MongoDB* as a database,*Express* as the frameWork and *HTML&CSS* as templating language.
## Prerequisites:
- npm
